# Quixel Megascans Scripts
A collection of Python scripts to facilitate claiming and downloading the *entire* [Quixel Megascans](https://quixel.com/) collection before it becomes [fully paid in 2025](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/blog/fab-content-marketplace-launches-in-october-publishing-portal-opens-today).

## Requirements
- **Python 3.12** (3.11 and prior do not work!)
- **requests** (pip)
- **tqdm** (pip)

## Getting your Quixel Token
### Firefox
The most reliable and easy way to get your Quixel token in Firefox I've found:
1. Go to [https://quixel.com/](https://quixel.com/) and log in.
2. Press **Ctrl+Shift+I** to open the Web Developer Tools.
3. Click on the Storage tab.
4. Open the Cookies dropdown in the left sidebar, and select the https://quixel.com option.
5. Click on the auth cookie in the main window.
6. Right-click and copy the `token` (not `refreshToken`) in the Parsed Value section in the right sidebar.
7. You're done! Any script that uses a token will parse the string you copied correctly, so don't worry if there is extra formatting. If you put the token in without any formatting, that should work as well.

### Chrome
Similar to the Firefox instructions:
1. Go to [https://quixel.com/](https://quixel.com/) and log in.
2. Press **Ctrl+Shift+I** to open the Developer Tools.
3. Click on the Application tab. If you don't see it, click the "More tabs" button next to the list of tabs and select it from there.
4. Open the Cookies dropdown in the left sidebar, and select the https://quixel.com option.
5. Click "Show URL-decoded" on the bottom pane and copy the entire Cookie Value, refresh token and all.
7. You're done! Any script that uses a token will parse the string you copied correctly, so don't worry if there is extra formatting. If you put the token in without any formatting, that should work as well.

## Instructions
### Metadata Creation
Each script (except [get_all_basic_asset_metadata.py](get_all_basic_asset_metadata.py)) requires a file called `asset_metadata.json` to be present alongside them.

This file is initially created using [get_all_basic_asset_metadata.py](get_all_basic_asset_metadata.py) with the basic, barebones metadata (name and asset ID) for each asset from Quixel.

Then, using [get_all_complete_asset_metadata.py](get_all_complete_asset_metadata.py), the *full* metadata for each asset is requested and saved to `asset_metadata.json` - when this process finishes, the file is about 1.5GB in size.

### Provided Metadata
For convenience, I've compressed the [*basic*](basic_asset_metadata.tar.zst) and [*complete*](complete_asset_metadata.tar.zst) stages of `asset_metadata.json` into separate .tar.zst files. Zstandard compression is pretty awesome, so I'm able to just provide these in the repository with zero compromises.

If you're on Windows, something like [7-Zip-zstd](https://github.com/mcmilk/7-Zip-zstd) should be able to decompress these.

### Claiming Assets
I'd wager most people who are here are most interested in mass-claiming all assets to their Quixel account. To do this, run [claim_all_assets.py](claim_all_assets.py) with either a [*basic*](basic_asset_metadata.tar.zst) or [*complete*](complete_asset_metadata.tar.zst) `asset_metadata.json` file present. There is no difference in functionality.

### Downloading Assets
If you want to download all Quixel assets, run [download_all_assets.py](download_all_assets.py) with a [*complete*](complete_asset_metadata.tar.zst) `asset_metadata.json` file in the directory you want to download assets to. It ***will not work*** with *basic* metadata.

## Future Features
- Full resume functionality for [get_all_basic_asset_metadata.py](get_all_basic_asset_metadata.py) and [get_all_complete_asset_metadata.py](get_all_complete_asset_metadata.py). This would also enable new assets to be added to the metadata if and when they appear.
- Switch from `tqdm` to `rich` to support things like a fancy spinner during checksum calculation and rich text.
- Better error handling across the board

## Why is there no initial commit history?
I initially developed these scripts in a private branch while I did silly things like committing my Quixel tokens to the branch. I also wanted to get these scripts in a decent enough state before releasing them, which did take a bit.

## Notice
Please note that these scripts have been developed with an emphasis on archival purposes, so scripts like [download_all_assets.py](download_all_assets.py) may not do what you want/expect at first. That script is straight and to the point - it downloads all assets to a single directory, and doesn't bother with things like asset categories. There is also (intentionally) *no* limit on retries.
